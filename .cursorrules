# AI Automation Rules

## General Principles
- Always use **Playwright** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern.
- All test cases must follow **ISTQB** requirements:
  - Clear **Preconditions**
  - Logical **Steps**
  - Specific **Expected Results**

## Code Structure
- Store page objects in the `/pages` directory.
- Store tests in the `/tests` directory.
- Use descriptive names for locators and methods.
- Ensure all code is clean, formatted, and follows DRY principles.

## Prompting Requirements
- When generating tests, always check if a Page Object already exists before creating a new one.
- Use `data-testid` as the preferred locator strategy.
