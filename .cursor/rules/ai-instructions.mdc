## 0. Technology Stack
- **Language**: All automation code (Page Objects and Specs) must be written strictly in **JavaScript**.
- **File Extensions**: Use `.js` extension for all files. Do not use TypeScript (`.ts`).

## 1. File Interaction
- Always interact only with files located in the `AIEnhancementTask` folder.
- Do not read or modify files outside this folder.

## 2. Page Object Model (POM)
- **MANDATORY**: Every test spec MUST have corresponding page object files.
- Always use the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern for structuring UI automation code.
- Store all page object files in:  `AIEnhancementTask/pageObjects`
- **NEVER create spec files without creating their corresponding page objects first**.
- All locators and page interactions must be defined in page objects, not in spec files.

## 3. Spec Files
- Always create spec/test files in:  `AIEnhancementTask/specs`.
- Do not place spec files outside this folder.

## 4. MCP Usage
- All navigation, assertion, AND LOCATOR DISCOVERY must be performed via playwright-mcp.
- Use MCP browser/inspector to derive selectors, do not guess or hardcode without MCP validation.
- For every new/changed locator:
  - Validate via MCP;
  - Prefer role/name, label, placeholder, accessible names, or test IDs exposed in DOM.

## 5. Prevent Auto-Generated / Random Spec Files
- Do not allow LLM or MCP to create random spec files like urltest_<uuid>.spec.
- Ensure AI-generated spec files are only created in `AIEnhancementTask/specs`.

## 6. General Notes
- Follow consistent naming conventions for pages and specs.
- Keep code modular and reusable within the defined folder structure.
- Review MCP logs to debug test execution if necessary.

## 7. Prohibition of Unsolicited Files and Content
- **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**: Do not create or modify any files other than the necessary Page Objects and Spec files unless explicitly requested.
- **No Documentation/Analysis**: Do not generate summaries, conclusion reports, analysis files, or logs unless a specific task requires it.
- **No README updates**: Never modify the `README.md` or any other project documentation file unless directly instructed to do so.
- The AI agent must focus solely on the automation code and the defined project structure within the `AIEnhancementTask` folder.

## 8. Test Granularity and Execution
- **One `test()` block per TC**: Every official Test Case (e.g., TC-03) must be implemented within exactly one `test()` block.
- **Sequential Steps**: All steps, actions, and assertions for a specific Test Case must be executed sequentially inside that single block.
- **No Fragmentation**: Do not split a single test case into multiple `test()` calls for individual links, buttons, or steps. 
- **Reporting Accuracy**: The total number of tests reported by the Playwright runner must strictly match the number of requested Test Cases (e.g., if 4 TCs are defined, the runner must show exactly 4 tests).
